% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional

% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use

% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/dblfloatfix/




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/url/
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

We consider the problem of minimizing the difference in the demand and the supply of the power using microgrids. We setup multiple microgrids, that provides electricity to a village. It has access to the batteries that can store renewable power and also the electrical lines from the main grid. At each time period, these microgrids need to take decision on amount of renewable power to be used from the batteries and amount of power needed from main grid. We formuate this problem in the framework of Markov Decision Process (MDP), similar to the one discussed in \cite{goodmdp}. The power allotment to the village from the main grid is fixed and bounded, whereas the renewable energy generation is uncertain in nature. Therefore we apply popular Reinforcement learning technique, Multi-Agent Q-Learning to the problem. Finally we consider a variant of this problem, where the cost of power production at main site is also taken into consideration. In this scenario, the microgrids need to minimize the demand-supply deficit, while maintaining the desired average cost of the power production.

\section{Introduction}

Electricity is one of the most important components of the modern life. According to a recent survey, there are a total of 18,452 unelectrified villages in India. Providing electricity to these villages is difficult for a number of reasons. The village may be situated very far away from the main grid and it would be difficult to establish a direct electrical line between the main grid and the village. Also, due to increasing global warming, we want to make less use of fossil fuels for the generation of power. Our objective in this work is to provide a solution to electrifying these villages.

The concept of smart grid \cite{weiss1999multiagent}, is aimed at improving traditional power grid operations.  It is a distributed energy network composed of intelligent nodes (or agents) that can either operate autonomously or communicate and share energy. The  power grid is facing wide variety of challenges due to incorporation of renewable and sustainable energy power generation sources. The aim of smart grid is to effectively deliver energy to consumers and maintain grid stability.

A microgrid is a distributed networked group consisting of renewable energy generation sources with aim of providing energy to small areas. This scenario is being envisaged as an important alternative to the conventional scheme with large power stations transmitting energy over long distances. The microgrid technology is useful particularly in the Indian context where extending power supply from the main grids to remote villages is a challenge. While the main power stations are highly connected, micro-grids with local power generation, storage and conversion capabilities, act locally or share power with a few neighboring micro-grid nodes \cite{farhangi2010path}.

A microgrid is a distributed networked group consisting of renewable energy generation sources with aim of providing energy to small areas. This scenario is being envisaged as an important alternative to the conventional scheme with large power stations transmitting energy over long distances. The microgrid technology is useful particularly in the Indian context where extending power supply from the main grids to remote villages is a challenge. While the main power stations are highly connected, micro-grids with local power generation, storage and conversion capabilities, act locally or share power with a few neighboring micro-grid nodes \cite{farhangi2010path}.



We setup microgrids closer to the villages, with an electricity connection from main grids. The microgrids will also be provided with batteries that can store renewable energy sources. Owing to the cost, these batteries will have limited storage capacities. Now each microgrid needs to take decision on amount of renewable energy that needs to be used at every time slot and the amount of power that needs to drawn from the main grid. Consider a scenario where, microgrids will use the renewable energy as it is. That is, they do not store the energy. Then, during the peak demand, if the amount of renewable energy generated is low and power obtained from the main grid is also low, it leads to huge blackout. Thus, it is important to intelligently store and use the renewable energy. In this work, we apply Multi-agent Q-learning algorithm to solve this problem. 


\section*{Organization of the Paper}	
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section describes the important problems associated with the microgrids and solution techniques to solve them. Section III presents the results of experiments of our algorithms. Section IV provides the concluding remarks and Section V discusses the future research directions.

\section{Our Work}
In this section, we discuss two important problems associated with the microgrids. We first formulate the problem in the framework of Markov Decision Process (MDP), similar to the one described in \cite{goodmdp}. We then apply cooperative Multi-Agent Q-Learning algorithm to solve the problems.

\subsection{Problem 1 - Minimizing Demand-Supply Deficit}

Consider a village that has not been electrified yet. We setup microgrids close to the village, and provides electrical connections to the village. It also has power connections from the main grid. Power supply is generally done in time slots, for example every two hours. Microgrids do not have non-renewable power generation capabilities. They have access to the renewable power and needs to obtain the excess power from the main grid. For ease of explanation, we consider two renewable sources - solar and wind. At the beginning of each time slot, microgrids obtain the power demand from customers with the help of the smart meters. These microgrids need to take decisions on amount of renewable power to be used so that the expected long term demand-supply deficit is minimized.

One natural solution without the use of storage batteries is to fully use the solar and wind power generated at every time slot. The excess demand will be then requested from the main grid. If the requested power is less than or equal to the maximum alloted power, the main grid transfers this to the microgrids. Other wise, it transfers the maximum alloted power. This idea is described in Algorithm 1.


\begin{algorithm}
\caption{}
\label{greedy}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
	\State Demand $\leftarrow$ Initial Demand
    \State get\_Demand(Demand) : Function that gives next Demand based on the current Demand.
    \State solar() : Function that computes solar power generated in a time slot
    \State wind() : Function that computes wind power generated in a time slot
    \State max\_prod : Maximum power alloted by the main grid.
    \State Deficit = 0 ; iterations = 0
    \Procedure{At every Time Slot}{}   
     \State $solar\_action = solar()$
     \State $wind\_action = wind()$
     \State $main\_action = max(0,min(max\_prod, Demand - (solar\_action+wind\_action)))$
     \State $Demand \leftarrow get\_Demand(Demand).$
     \State $Deficit += Demand - (solar\_action + wind\_action + main\_action)$
     \State $iterations += 1;$
    \EndProcedure
    \State $Average Deficit = Deficit/iterations;$
    
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}


Our objective in the current work is to do better than the above described solution. Microgrids are equipped with the batteries that can store the renewable power. That is, we deploy the microgrids at the sites where there is availability of renewable resources. The goal is to intelligently use the stored power in batteries and take the optimal action at every time slot to minimize the demand-supply deficit.

We formulate the problem in the framework of Markov Decision Process (MDP). MDP \cite{sutton} is the most popular mathematical framework for modeling optimal sequential decision making problems under uncertainty. A Markov decision process is defined via tuple $< S; A; P;R >$, where S is the set of states. A is the set of actions. P respectively the probability transition matrix. $P_{a}(s,s^{'})$ is the probability that action $a$ in the state $s$, result into the state $s^{'}$. R is the reward function where $R_{a}(s,s^{'})$ is the reward obtained by taking action $a$ in the state $s$ and the $s^{'}$ being the next state. In infinite horizon discounted setting \cite{vol1}, the goal is to obtain a stationary policy $\pi$, which is a mapping from state space to action space that maximizes the following objective:

\begin{equation}
\sum_{t = 0}^{\infty} \gamma^{t}R_{a_{t}}(s_{t},s_{t+1}),
\end{equation}
where $a_{t} = \pi(s_{t}),$ and $\gamma \in [0,1]$ is the discount factor.

We model Power Demand as a Markov process. That is, the current Demand depends only on the previous value. The Demand value, and the amount of power left in the batteries form the state of the MDP. That is, 
\begin{equation}
 state = [Demand,\hspace{0.1cm} solar\_batterylevel,\hspace{0.1cm} wind\_batterylevel].
\end{equation}

Based on the current state, the microgrids need to take decision on the number of units of power to be used from their batteries, and amount of power that is needed from the main grid. Note that the power from the main grid is fixed and bounded at all the time periods, while power from the  renewable sources is uncertain in nature. 

\begin{equation}
Action = [solar\_power,\hspace{0.1cm} wind\_power,\hspace{0.1cm} main\_power],
\end{equation}

The state evolves as follows:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
solar\_batterylevel &= solar\_batterylevel - solar\_power \\&\hspace{1cm}+ solar(), 
\end{split}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
wind\_batterylevel &= wind\_batterylevel - wind\_power 
\\&\hspace{1cm}  + wind(),
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where
$solar()$ and $wind()$ are the solar and wind power generation policies. 
Our objective is to minimize the long term average difference in the demand and supply of the power. So, the single stage Reward function is as follows:
%$$ Single\_stage\_cost\_function  =$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
R = -&(Demand - \\
&(solar\_power+wind\_power+main\_power))^2
\end{split}
\end{equation}
When there is uncertainty in the system, like the renewal energy generation in this case, tradition solution techniques like value iteration and policy iterations cannot be applied. Reinforcement Learning provides us with the algorithms which can be applied when the model information is not completely known. One such popular model-free algorithm is Q-learning \cite{vol2}. However, microgrids applying Q-Learning independently is not a feasible solution, as they are working towards a common goal. Hence we apply co-operative Multi-Agent Q-Learning algorithm \cite{marl} to solve the problem. At every slot, the microgrids exchange the battery level information among themselves. Then they apply Q-Learning on the joint state and obtain the joint action. Each microgrid then selects its respective action. Let the joint state at time $k$ be $s_{k}$. We select a joint action, based on a $\epsilon-$greedy policy. Let it be $a_{k}$ and so we move to a new state $s_{k+1}$. Let the single stage reward obtained be $r_{k}$ Then the Q-values are updated as follows:
\begin{equation}\label{Q-val}
\begin{split}
Q(s_{k},a_{k}) = Q(s_{k},a_{k}) + \\
 \alpha[r_{k}+\gamma max_{a}Q(s_{k+1},a) - Q(s_{k},a_{k})], 
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha \in [0,1]$ is the learning parameter and $\gamma \in [0,1]$ is the discount factor.

We update this Q-values until convergence. At the end of this process, we will have an optimal policy that gives for each state, the optimal action to be taken. The idea is described in  Algorithm 2.

\subsection{Problem 2 - Balancing Demand-Supply Deficit and cost of Power Production}
In the above formulation, cost of the non-renewable power production at the main grid site is not taken into consideration. Therefore, it is natural to use the entire power obtained from the main grid and the optimization is done on the amount of power drawn from the solar and the wind batteries. In this formulation, we put a cost on amount of power that can be obtained from the main grid. That is, we modify our single stage Reward as follows:
\begin{equation}\label{prob2}
\begin{split}
 -c*(Demand - (solar\_power + wind\_power+ \\
 main\_power))^2+(1-c)*(main\_power)^2.\\
 c \in[0,1],
 \end{split}
\end{equation}


where $c$ is the parameter that controls the demand-supply objective and the main grid production cost. Note here that when $c =1$, it is same as the problem 1. Similar to the above problem, we apply multi-agent Q-Learning to obtain the optimal solution. 

\section{Experiments}
We consider 2 microgrids operating on the solar and the wind power batteries respectively. Demand values are taken to be 8,10 and 12. The probability transition matrix for the Demand is given below. 

$$ P = [0.1\hspace{0.1cm}0.6\hspace{0.1cm} 0.3; 0.3\hspace{0.1cm} 0.1\hspace{0.1cm} 0.6; 0.6 \hspace{0.1cm}0.3 \hspace{0.1cm}0.1];$$

The maximum storage capacity of the batteries is set to 5. The renewable energy generation process, for simulation purposes is taken to be Poisson with mean 2. Discount factor of the Q-learning is set to 0.9.

We begin our simulations with the state $[8,5,5]$. First we run Algorithm 1 for $10^6$ iterations and compute the average deficit in demand and the supply. We run Algorithm 2 for $10^8$ iterations with $\epsilon-$greedy policy with $\epsilon = 0.85$ and obtain an optimal policy. We then compute the average deficit using optimal Q-values for $10^4$ iterations. We compare both the algorithms in Figure 1.

With regard to the problem 2, we plot the values of average deficit in the power and the average production at the main grid obtained by different values of $c$ in \eqref{prob2}. The maximum power allocation at the main site is set to 8. This is shown in Figure 2.

 \caption{Algorithm 2 applied to Problem 2}
 \end{center}
 \end{figure}

\subsection{Observations}

\begin{itemize}
\item In Figure 1, we see that the Algorithm 1 performs better than the Algorithm 2, when the Maximum Power Allocation (MPA) at the main site is less than 3. This is because, when the MPA is very less compared to the minimum demand, storing the power in the batteries doesn't provide any advantage. 
\item On the other hand, if the MPA is closer to the minimum demand, the Algorithm 2 outperforms the Algorithm 1. 
\item In Figure 2, we observe that as the value of $c$ increases, the average demand-supply deficit decreases and the average power obtained from the main grid increases. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
We considered the problem of electrifying a village by setting up microgrids close to the village. These microgrids have access to the renewable energy storage batteries and also connections from the main grid. We identified two problems associated with the microgrid. One problem is to minimize the expected long-run discounted demand-supply deficit. We model this problem in the framework of MDP. This formulation doesn't take into consideration the cost of power production at the main grid site. Finally, we formulated MDP taking the cost of production in to consideration. We applied Multi-Agent Q-Learning algorithm to solve these problems. Simulations show that, when maximum power allocation at the main site is not very less, storing the power in the batteries and using them intelligently is the better solution compared to not using the storage batteries. 

\section{Future Work}
In Future, we would like to consider the possibility of power sharing between the microgrids. In this case, along with decision on amount to be used from stored batteries, microgrids also have to take decision on amount of power that can be shared with others. We would also like to consider the  heterogeneous power price system. In this scenario, price of power production at the main grid varies from time to time.
